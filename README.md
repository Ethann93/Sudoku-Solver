# Sudoku Solver

I programmed this Sudoku solver due to my love of the game and the challenge of solving Sudoku puzzles. Sudoku is a popular number-placement puzzle game that requires logic and patience to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers. This code provides a solution to Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm.

## Sudoku: The Game
Sudoku is a classic puzzle game that became widely popular in the late 20th century. The game is typically played on a 9x9 grid, which is further divided into nine 3x3 subgrids, known as "boxes." The objective of Sudoku is to fill the entire grid with numbers so that each column, each row, and each 3x3 box contains all the numbers from 1 to 9 without any repetitions. The puzzle starts with some cells pre-filled with numbers, and your task is to complete the grid while following the rules.

## How the Sudoku Solver Works
This Sudoku solver is implemented in Python and follows a backtracking algorithm to find the solution to a given puzzle. Here's how it works:

1. The **solve(bo)** function is the heart of the solver. It recursively attempts to fill the Sudoku grid by placing numbers from 1 to 9 into empty cells while ensuring the rules of Sudoku are followed.

2. The **valid(bo, num, pos)** function checks if it's valid to place a number num in a specific position **pos** on the Sudoku board. It verifies the number's validity within the current row, column, and 3x3 subgrid (box).

3. The **find_empty(bo)** function is used to locate the next empty cell in the puzzle. It iterates through the board to find the first cell with a value of 0.

4. As **the solve(bo)** function attempts to fill cells, it checks if the placement is valid using the **valid** function. If valid, it proceeds; if not, it backtracks to the previous cell and explores alternative solutions.

5. If a solution is found, the puzzle is filled with the correct numbers. If no solution exists for the given puzzle, the solver indicates that the puzzle cannot be solved.

## How to Use the Solver

You can use this Sudoku solver to solve Sudoku puzzles of your choice. Simply provide the initial puzzle by modifying the **board** variable in the code. Then, execute the code. The solver will print the initial puzzle and, if a solution exists, it will display the solved Sudoku puzzle.

Enjoy playing Sudoku and have fun challenging yourself with this Sudoku solver!
